### Seeding

Step 1) If you wish to seed the database with dummy data the first thing that you must do after following the instructions above is to
run ```npm seed```. This will seed the database with demo data. **CAUTION DOING SO WILL DROP ALL TABLES RELEVANT TO THIS
DATABASE**

Step 2) now that you have seeded the database run ```npm start``` in the command line at the root of the repository.
This will start up the server on port 3001 provided that you are running this on your local machine, and you did not
specify a port in your .env. navigate to localhost:3001 (or the port number that appears in the command line) in your
web browser, and you should be meet with the Quick-Techie website. Have Fun!

### Without Seeding

Step 1) Once you have finished following the instructions for installation you may launch the application by
running ```npm start``` in the command line at the root of the repository. In the command prompt the port that the
application is running on will be displayed. by default It will run on port 3001. Visit localhost:3001 in your browser (
or the port specified otherwise) in your browser, and you should be meet with the Quick-Techie website. Have Fun!
